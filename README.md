# Pesa

* Pesa is a cryptocurrency built on the 'FirstChain', a blockchain created in Python, designed to allow users to interact with Pesa through a live web server built using the Flask framework of Python. The blockchain consists of multiple nodes that can send or receive tokens from each other, enabling transactions within the Pesa ecosystem. 

* The project's use of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger in the JSON format, providing transparency and accountability.

* One of the features of the Pesa blockchain is its 'proof of work' system. The system uses a complex mathematical puzzle and the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, ensuring the Pesa network remains secure and resistant to attacks.
